## This code is a Cloud Function designed to query a Cloud SQL Postgres database using natural language. It leverages two GenAI Models, Code-Bison and Text-Bison, to generate SQL queries based on user input and summarize the results using a Large Language Model (LLM).

### How it works:

The handle_webhook function processes the incoming Dialogflow request, which includes the user's question.

It then passes the question to the create_sql_cloud_sql function, which uses Code-Bison to generate a SQL query.

The create_sql_cloud_sql function interacts with the Vertex AI API, providing the question as input to the LLM.

The LLM generates a SQL query based on the provided question and the predefined rules and schema.

The generated SQL query is then passed to the execute_query function, which establishes a connection to the Cloud SQL Postgres database and executes the query.

The execute_query function retrieves the results and commits them to the database.

Finally, the summarize_with_llm function uses Text-Bison to summarize the query results.

The summarized result is returned as a text response to the Dialogflow fulfillment.

For optimal performance of the Cloud Function, make sure to provide the correct environment variables and update the schema based on your specific table structure. Additionally, you may need to customize the prompts and rules according to your desired use case.

You can use this code for any project that requires natural language processing and summarization of data stored in a Cloud SQL Postgres database.
